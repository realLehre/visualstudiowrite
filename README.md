Looking to practice and get more projects done, so I took a look at VS Code's landing page and decided to give it a trial. I replicated all major sections to the best of my skills and I'm looking to learn more.
Changed the main color (blue) to green to avoid piracy.
I actually cropped the showcase image off (using photoshop) a screenshot from the real VS Code homepage as it wasn't downladable.
Was able to get most of the images and 'download icons' from the webpack I download, also from the real VS Code homepage (right-click from anywhere on the page and click 'save as').
The icons used in the section directly after the showcase area, I got them from fontawesome. Really cool platform.
I used owl carousel for the testiomial slider, it's free and easy to use.
I hope this helps someone who's looking to learn, just like I am.
